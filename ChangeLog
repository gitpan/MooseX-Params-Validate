Revision history for Perl extension MooseX-Params-Validate

0.12 Tue. Jul. 7, 2009
    - Using the subroutine name as a cache key for validation specs
      broke in the face of method modifiers, which all appear to have
      the same name. Now we use Devel::Caller to get the CV of the
      caller and use its refaddr as the key, which will be unique in
      all cases. Bug report by Jos Boumans. RT #46730.

0.11 Tue. Jul. 7, 2009
    - The validation functions tried to coerce optional keys which
      weren't present in the incoming parameters, leading to weird
      errors. Based on a patch from Jos Boumans. RT #46344. 

    - Allow other callbacks to be specified. Previously these were
      silently thrown out. But we'd recommend just defining types that
      encapsulate everything in the callback instead. Based on a patch
      from Jos Boumans. RT #47647.
	
0.10 Tue. Jun. 30, 2009
    - Shut up deprecation warnings from the tests. Reported by John
      Goulah.

0.09 Sun. Feb. 1, 2009
    - The subroutine name being reported in error messages was screwy.

0.08 Sun. Feb. 1, 2009
    - Renamed validate to validated_hash and validatep to
      validated_list. The old function names are still available under
      the ":deprecated" import tag.

    - Added a new pos_validated_list which can validate position
      parameters.

    - Errors now reflect the subroutine that called the validation
      function, rather than coming form inside the validation function
      itself.

    - No code changes, just fixing missing prereqs (Dave Rolsky)

0.06 Sat. Sep. 20, 2008
    - Fixes to work with Moose 0.58 (Dave Rolsky)

    - Switched to using Module::Install (Dave Rolsky)

0.05 Fri. Mar. 7th, 2008
    - This package would cause a fatal error if loaded
      by a non-Moose class (Dave Rolsky)
      - added tests for this (Dave Rolsky)

    - Added support for coercions (Dave Rolsky)

0.04 Tues. Jan. 8th, 2008
    - upped the Moose dependency and added support
      for the new improved Moose type constraints
      - added tests for this
    
    - adding caching of the prepared parameter 
      specs, this results in approx. 3x speedup 
      using rough benchmarks. 
      
    - added special caching handlers see the 
      IMPORTANT NOTE ON CACHING section of the 
      POD for more details
      - added tests for this

0.03 Fri. June 8th, 2007
    - added support for using this 
      within role methods too.

0.02 Wed. April 25, 2007
    - added validatep, which returns the captured
      args as positional instead of as hash
      - added docs and tests

0.01 Wed. April 18, 2007
    - trying to fill a gap, we will see ...
